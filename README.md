## ✨ NOTE:

- I have tested both on Gnome and Plasma Wayland HOWEVER, I have ran into issues like wallpaper not being persistent

## ✨ Installation and usage:

1.) Install swwww (Arch Linux available in AUR swww and swww-git), Gentoo, is available in GURU overlay. Please check swww github page or you can build from source

2.) Inorder to use wallpaper-switcher, wofi have to be installed. I upload a wofi config folder. You can put this folder inside ~/.config

3.) Users who previously used my scripts for installing Hyprland, need to rename or update the wallpaper.

4.) To use your own wallpaper for wallpaper-switcher, edit as required. Its important to change the directory and wallpaper name else script will fail

5.) Will integrate both scripts in my previous Hyprland install
